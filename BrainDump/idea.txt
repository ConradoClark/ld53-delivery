Final Idea: Prototype ARPG With BEEES

- Carry pollen from one flower to another to make an area flourish
- Bees are being affected by social media and refusing to pollinate
- They're fighting whoever tries to pollinate
- ARPG, but kinda Vampire Survivors, you can only use dodge moves, attacks are automatically issued
- Contact damage, and projectiles
- Random loot, only one equipment slot, controlled by NP (Nectar Points)
- Level ups, fight enemies, multiple maps, enemies respawn
- Mini map (maybe tailored, I don't think I'll have time to make it random)
- Random enemies, random loot
- Skill Tree (in the shape of a flower), where you can upgrade your bee
- Attacks and defensive mechanisms are activated by your equipment, so your loot can improve your attacks (your skills could, also, do that)
