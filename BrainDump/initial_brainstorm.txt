Delivery

Brainstorming
- Delivering packages to someone
- Intercepting deliveries
- Helping deliveries get there faster
- Maybe some kinda mario & wario thing
- Trade routes
- Santa (deliver presents)
- Fedex (packages and/or paperboy style)
- Carrying something from point A to point B
- Carrying things may change how you play the game
- Help someone carry something to somewhere
- Make efficient routes to deliver stuff
- Timer-based deliveries (food cannot get cold, gift needs to arrive before birthday, etc)
- Taking care so the package gets there safely (hazards)
- Top-down, protect the package kinda thing?
- Play as santa, figure out presents etc, kinda carmem sandiego, adventure thing
- Communication (delivering a message)
- Message in the bottle kinda thing
- What things can be delivered?
  + General products (packages)
  + Food
  + Presents/Gifts
  + Newspapers
  + Organs
  + Medicine
  + People?
- You can play either as:
  + The one who delivers
  + The one who helps delivering
  + The one who makes something for delivery
  + The recipient of the delivery
- A game mocking you for being the delivery person (mocking MMOs kinda thing)
- You are the present?
- What prevents the thing from being delivered?
  + Delivery as a throwing mechanic (controls challenge)
  + Other actors trying to stop it (gameplay challenge)
  + There's a timer and you have to be fast
- How to incorporate the theme "Delivery" into everything on the game?
  + By being the deliverable?
  + By allowing deliverables to change game mechanics
- Gift factory
  + Make machines to build gifts and to deliver them
  + Like a factorio kinda thing?
